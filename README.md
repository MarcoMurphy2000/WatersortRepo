# WatersortRepo Development
Watersort game created in Java 

Problem solving approach:
Step 1: understand the problem.
Step 2: create a step-by-step plan for how you'll solve it.
Step 3: carry out the plan and write the actual code.
Step 4: look back and possibly refactor your solution if it could be better.

This code is all for fun. The game consists of bottles with mixed ink leaving the player with the problem of getting each bottle filled with only one color of ink.
